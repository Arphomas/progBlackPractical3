				<h1>Use of computing within Medical fields</h1>
			</div>
			<p>Medicine is incredibly important to everyone, and, with the exception of some skeptics, the world is greatly benefitted from any advancements in the field which help people to live longer, and survive more and more previously deadly or dangerous conditions or events. In the past 70 years, as we entered the Information Age and our understanding of computing and its uses has grown ever larger, significant advancements have been made towards the health and wellbeing of everyone around the globe, through the identification of new diseases, the testing and creating of new cures, and even incredible feats such as the Human Genome Project. 
			<h1>Cancer Diagnosis</h1>
			<p>In 2020, nearly 10 million people died to cancer, out of an approximate total of 60 million deaths. Even despite the global pandemic of Covid-19, cancer was still the cause of 1 in 6 deaths. As our lifespans increase due to modern medicine, it grows more and more likely that someone develops cancer due to how long they have been alive, and how deteriorated their cells and DNA already are. Subsequently, roughly 50% of the population is currently expected to have some form of cancer at some point in their life, and as such the importance and drive to find safer and more reliable cures for cancer has never been greater.</p>
			<p>Over the past decade or so, the world of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), or our early attempts to approximate one, have grown rapidly and begun being applied to many different tasks across the globe. From generative AI such as Chat GPT for autocorrect or predictive typing for communication, to pattern recognition such as ANPR or Tesla cars for road safety, some form of AI is likely already affecting your day-to-day life. Some applications can be truely lifesaving however, and one incredibly promising one is the use of ML to train computers to identify cancer cells from MRI scans.</p>
			<p>Traditionally, cancer is spotted through methods that can either miss or misdiagnose conditions. If a doctor is looking at MRI scans for cancer, but the spots that are cancer don't show up properly, than the patient is likely to be let go, and could progress much further or even metastasize before the cancer is spotted due to other symptoms. Similarly, taking blood or urine samples to find cancer cells could simply be unlucky and completely miss the cancer, or not have a high enough concentration to trigger the test as positive, which again can lead to later stages and metastasis.</p>
			<p>With the growing popularity of AI, many researchers have begun training them to be able to spot cancer cells, and the trials are looking very promising. With much more knowledge about how cancer presents in scans than any doctor is likely to have, or be able to fully remember, an AI can look at an abnormality in a scan and compare it with thousands of other cases of confirmed cancer cells, and quickly determine if it is cancerous with high precision. AIs are, however, slow to train and expensive to run, and so any redesigns on the working of the AI can be costly, both monitarily and in terms of time, which some patients may not have. It is also difficult to tell if the conclusion an AI has made is correct, unless the data is already know to the researchers and just not fed to the AI previously, or if the researchers then do a test of their own on the patient, which could take a long time or be inaccurate. As such they are not massively relied upon yet, though as they become more and more refined, it is likely inevitable that they will become the leading diagnostic tool for cancer, massively reducing the time and error rate for identifying cancer, and allowing us much more time to use our cures, as even experimental cures will have higher chances of success if fighting a cancer that is caught that much earlier, and therefore is weaker.</p>
