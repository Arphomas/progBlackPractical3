				<p>Remote work has been made very convenient by computers because it allows one to do their job without the need to go to the office in cases where doing so would be either an inconvenience or impossible.</p>

				<p>Remote work is also good for some people because it means that one would have more freedom to live wherever they want - they don't need to move to a different location because that's where their job is.</p>

				<p>It also lowers the cost for companies because they don't need to rent office spaces for their employees. It's cheaper for employees because they don't need to pay for transport. It may be better for the well-being of workers because they work in their own home, and less time is wasted in transport.</p>

				<p>Another example of working from home being good is to imagine you are a parent of some children, and let's also say that you have some jobs spread out across the day with gaps in between. If you are working from home, it is possible for you to spend time with your children in between jobs. If you wanted to do this while working in an office, you would need to constantly travel between the office and home, or bring your children their, which often isn't possible. In this example, working from home is good for the well-being of your own children, and it may be the difference between needing to pay for a babysitter or not.</p>

				<p>My last example of working from home being good is that it may be the case that an area has really low house prices, but also lacks high paying jobs. Working from home allows one to work around that problem, since it is easier to have a high-paying job somewhere else, perhaps overseas, and then live in a low-cost house.</p>
