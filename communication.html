				<p>Before the telegraph was invented, its inventor, Samuel Morse, was a painter. While he was in Washington D.C., he sent a letter to his wife, who had already died unbeknownst to him of a heart attack while recovering from childbirth. Samuel Morse rushed back to his family as soon as he received the letter from his father informing him of his wife's passing. By the time Samuel arrived, however, his wife Lucretia had already been buried, as any form of long-distance communication was incredibly slow. This incident may have been a factor that inspired the invention of the telegraph, which replaced the old, extremely slow method of communication via letters which Samuel and everyone else was using and it highlights how important fast and reliable communication is, which we take for granted today.</p>

				<p>After the the telegraph, several more methods of communication were invented, such as the telephone and computer networks, which is what I will be talking about in this article. Using computers to communicate has been around for a long time already and it has made the world seem significantly smaller than it did before, allowing for fast, real-time communication even between places on opposite sides of the globe, where communication can be done through text, speaking or even video calls, which would have been considered science fiction a few decades ago.</p>

				<p>Communication over computers has a variety of applications:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It can be used for remote work, which reduces the need for workers to go to the office, <a href="remote_work.html">more information about that here</a>.</li>
					<li>It can be used for people to connect and even form friendships where doing so would have been otherwise infeasible due to the long distance. This has been used to foster long-distance relationships between people, like what happened with my own parents.</li>
					<li>News can be delivered to people much faster, which could either be from your standard news outlets, like the BBC. It also could be your father informing you that your husband/wife is about to die and that you should go over there right now, like what happened to Samuel Morse, except that Samuel would have been there for the funeral if he had access to the internet like we do now.</li>
					<li>It allows friends and family to keep in touch regularly and quickly even when they are not living in the same place.</li>
					<li>Information can be communicated to people much better because people can create publicly/privately accessible information on the internet. For example, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia.org</a>.</li>
					<li>It is very useful for people to have their voices heard where it otherwise would have been either very difficult or impossible. It is much easier for an average person today to publish articles on the internet for people to see. It is also much easier for journalists to publish articles if they are living in an authoritarian place, for instance.</li>
