			<p>As our knowledge of technology continues to grow, we can build smaller and more complex systems that can achieve a wide variety of jobs, whether these be general systems that can do myriad tasks, or specialized devices that are designed for a specific niche. Within medicine, computer systems and similar devices have become invaluable pieces of equipment for dealing with specific diagnoses. From the Da Vinci Surgical System and Dialysis machines, to insulin pumps and pace makers, our evolution in computing has had signifiant impact in how we can mitigate and treat all manner of injuries and diseases.</p>

			<h3>The Da Vinci Surgical System</h3>
			<p>The Da Vinci Surgical System is a device that uses multiple small robot arms and tools, as well as remote control, to operate within a much smaller area than a human would be able to achieve with standard tools, and with much less damage to the tissue being operated on. The device is perhaps best known to the general public for operating on a grape and a banana, as these were demonstrations of the size and precision allowed by the system. It was first used in 2000, and in 2012 was used in approximately 200,000 different surguries, primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy">hysterectomies</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy">prostatectomies</a>. However, costing nearly 2 million USD (1.54 million GBP) the system and its proprietary software is not readily available in every institution.</p>
			<p>The systems main uses are in surguries around the lower abdomen, where there are many different organs and not necessarily as much room to access the body as with the upper abdomen. Such surguries include the aforementioned hysterectomies and prostatectomies, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy">neprectomies</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy">cystectomies</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatal_hernia">hiatal</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia">inguinal</a> hernias. It is also used for operations on the Gastrointestinal tract, as well as removal of head and neck cancers, and even the very first fully robotic lung transplant.</p>
